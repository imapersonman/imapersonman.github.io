    <p>Northeastern’s undergraduate research capstone course has made this the most fulfilling semester of my college career.  With that in mind, I am very much looking forward to it being over.</p>

<p>Below is a reflection essay I wrote for my capstone, and my final paper for the report can be found <a href="https://koissiadjorlolodotnet.wordpress.com/2019/12/01/capstone-reflection-final-report/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Before the semester had begun, my goal for Math 4020 was to simply feel that I was getting closer to being able to develop the software I’d like to eventually develop.  However, this goal wasn’t as well-defined as the course required, so I wrote in my proposal that I wanted to start proving statements in a variety of logical systems using Coastline.  Learning Natural Deduction has brought me closest to that goal, and if I could redo Math 4020, I would start learning it and other proof systems earlier in the semester.  I would also have read more about type theory and the Curry-Howard isomorphism. Chances are I wouldn’t have been able to do much on the subjects by the end of the semester, but the topics are very interesting and I’m anxious to start learning more about them.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed Math 4020 and believe it to be an experience that more mathematics students should take advantage of. Preparing for presentations was frustrating at times, as I often felt my time could be better spent working on more interesting aspects of my project.  I no longer feel this way, as the presentations were great opportunities to get feedback on how to clearly explain my project.</p>

<p>The most stressful part of the course occurred around the time the ethics essay was due.  I liked the discussion around the assignment and enjoyed thinking about it.  However, having it due a day after the first draft of the final paper was difficult, so I didn’t have nearly as much time to work on it as I had hoped.  This wasn’t just because of 4020, though, as I had substantial assignments from other classes due around the same time.  I would suggest separating the due dates for the final report’s rough draft and the ethics assignment.  It would also be helpful if the constraints on the required readings for the ethics assignment were lifted.  I went through three different topics while trying to find one that I could connect to the four required readings.  The readings should still be required going forward, but only for the sake of the discussion, and not the essay.</p>

<p>The progress report and final due dates were more stressful for me than they needed to be.  I would suggest that future students update their progress reports relatively frequently, as I often underestimated the amount of time it would take to copy my notes into Latex.  I would start updating my progress report a week or so before important deadlines and realize too late that I didn’t know how to communicate some part of my project in a clear enough way.  This forced me to add substantial sections to my report at the last minute.  The latter half of my project relied heavily on the Latex package bussproofs, and I spent the days leading up to one of the deadlines struggling to learn how to use it.  I spent a large portion of the final few weeks of the project designing a proof builder which I was unable to include in my final report because I realized too late that I couldn’t include it without adding sections explaining Software Development principles.  All of this could have been avoided if I had a central Latex document that I updated on a regular basis.</p>

<p>My interest in mathematics came from my interest in programming computers, which in turn came from my interest in problem solving in its most general form. I’ve always enjoyed browsing Wikipedia articles on math and computer science topics I hardly understood, as well as watching videos and reading articles about topics I found interesting within the subjects.  These activities motivated me to do well in high school so that I may one day be able to understand the topics I read about.  I soon became addicted to the feeling associated with problem solving, especially solving problems that I was able to both discover and solve on my own. I assumed that my inherent love of problem solving would carry me through my undergraduate and graduate studies but faced a very different reality shortly after arriving at Northeastern in 2015.  I was suddenly surrounded by students at least as interested in math and computer science but more knowledgeable in the subjects than I was.  Despite my love of math and computer science, I was discouraged by what I perceived as fundamental differences between the abilities of these other students and my own.  This coupled with a number of other life events led me to leave Northeastern in late November 2015, without any intention of returning.</p>

<p>Upon returning home, I stopped reading articles and watching videos about my beloved subjects and stopped seeking out problems to try and solve.  This state persisted for many months, and I can only speculate on why it lifted. While reflecting upon this experience, I’ve determined that the existence of students who are more advanced in math and CS than I am doesn’t imply that I am limited in what I am able to learn about the subject.  Moreover, limitations to my own abilities don’t have to get in the way of my inherent enjoyment of the subjects.  I still compare my own abilities to the abilities of others but am less likely to let my perceived weaknesses discourage me from doing mathematics. Math 4020 helped me with this, as I was immediately struck by how talented and motivated the other students in the course are, but at the same time humble in their own abilities and quick to get to the bottom of what they didn’t understand.  Everyone seemed to run towards what they didn’t understand instead of away from it.  I will probably feel discouraged by my perceived inabilities in the future but believe that my experiences in Math 4020 will allow me to overcome them.</p>

<p>I know that I will always have a special place in my heart for mathematics, but don’t know if that means I want to be a mathematician.  At this point in my life, everything I want to do and learn intersects significantly with mathematics.  This may or may not be the case going forward.  I can imagine myself learning about topics within mathematics I find interesting, but as I’ve already learned with programming, one’s relationship with an activity changes once it becomes a job.  I, like many others, ultimately want the intellectual freedom to learn topics and work on problems that I find interesting.  Professor Fitelson tells me that Philosophy is the best route to achieve this.  If it turns out that mathematics is my best bet to achieving this level of intellectual freedom, then I guess I’ll try becoming a mathematician.</p>
